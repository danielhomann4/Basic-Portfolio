            <p id="about">My name is Daniel Homann, and I am 21 years of age.  The Lakers are my favorite basketball team
            and my favorite player from the team is Rondo.  I am currently taking one class at Fullerton 
            Community College as well as a coding bootcamp at UCI.  My hope from the bootcamp is to get 
            a full time job in the field or be able to do freelance work.
